          <div class="text">
            <h3>Only Two Uses</h3>
            <p>
              Centrailized exchanges should only be used as a means to get your
              fiat currency such as United States Dollars (USD) from your bank
              account and into a crypto coin. On the flip side, you also use centralized exchanges to transfer back out of crypto and into your bank account.
            </p>
            <h3>Don't Trade</h3>
            <p>
              Centralized exchanges SHOULD NOT be used to hold or trade crypto,
              they defeat the entire purpose of decentralized finance. They can
              seize your crypto, freeze your account, make terrible decisions
              and go bankrupt, or any number of things.
            </p>
            <h3>Hold your Keys</h3>
            <p>
              The beauty of DeFi crypto is that if you hold the keys to your
              own wallet, no one can take your crypto away from you. You are in
              complete control. You are insulated from the greed and corruption
              of centralized exchanges.
            </p>
            <h3>Freedom</h3>
            <p>
              Hey lets be honest you might invest in $hit coins or gamble on
              some lotto tokens that drop 90% however thats your prerogative!!!
              You should be in control of your own keys. We are rooting for you
              to get a Lambo!

                      may take a few days before Coinbase allows you to send
                      this out of their exchange. Depending on the amount
                      sometimes it may take a week. If so come back next week
                      and move to step 2!!

                    to scam you. Print it out and store it in a safety deposit

                <h3>Moving out of Coinbase</h3>
                <p>
                  Now it's time to transfer your ETH out of Coinbase and into
                  your newly created MetaMask wallet. What you‚Äôll need for this
                  step is the wallet address from MetaMask. The video below
                  outlines exactly how to do this.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Login to coinbase click the "Transfer" button at the top
                    right.
                  </li>
                  <li>Select the first option "Send Crypto".</li>
                  <li>
                    You can then specify the amount you would like to send.
                    Switch the view to ETH to send a specific amount of ETH such
                    as 0.5 ETH. Optionally you can specify the USD equivalent
                    amount of ETH to send.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next click "To: Network and Recipient". Click "Ethereum" as
                    that is the network we will be sending the crypto on. Now
                    you are ready to paste in the address of your MetaMask
                    wallet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click the fox icon in your browser to open your MetaMask
                    wallet. At the top there is a small pane where it shows some
                    of the first and last characters of your wallet address
                    "0xAKSK....90991" as an example. Click on this and it will
                    copy it to your clipboard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In coinbase paste your copied address in the search field at the
                    top entitled "Ethereum address or ENS" and hit Enter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click Preview Send. Here you will see an overview of what
                    will happen. How much ETH you are sending, how much ETH will
                    be spent as a transaction fee (gas fee), and to whom you are
                    sending. Please verify it is your wallet! The gas fees may be
                    high during times of high usuage on the network. Soon we
                    will be switching to a new network, PulseChain, where the
                    gas fees are more like one to two cents.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If everything looks good, send your ETH! It may take some
                    time to send over, Coinbase shows the estimated amount of
                    time for the transaction to be written to the blockchain.
                    After this the ETH will show up in your MetaMask Wallet!!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    CONGRATS!! At this point you have crypto which you actually
                    OWN the KEYS for!!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now lets work on getting to a more efficient network and
                    getting Nachos to celebrate!

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The PulseChain network has substantially cheaper

                  <li>
                    We are going to use a service called UniSwap to make the
                    switch. (There are many other ways to do this)

                  <li>
                    Click on Connect Wallet. Select the MetaMask Icon. Click
                    Next in the window. Then click Connect. Your wallet is now
                    connected and we are going to make the swap.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Note: Don't swap all of the ETH because you will need some
                    ETH later on for gas fees if you swap back to the ETH
                    network. We leave about $50 worth of ETH in there.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click on Select Token. In the search bar paste in the WPLS
                    token address. The address is
                    <code>0xA882606494D86804B5514E07e6Bd2D6a6eE6d68A</code>.

                    Click on "Wrapped Pulse from PulseChain" item that pops up.

                  <li>
                    Now choose your amount of ETH to swap, remembering to leave
                    some gas in the tank.

                  <li>
                    When you are ready, hit Swap. It will then ask you to review
                    and confirm the swap. Then MetaMask will pop up, scroll down
                    to click the blue Confirm Button.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After a few moments UniSwap will inform you that the swap
                    was succesful. In order to view the WPLS in your MetaMask
                    wallet on the Ethereum network, we will need to add the
                    token to MetaMask.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click the fox to open MetaMask, Select the Tokens tab, and
                    then click the link "+ Import Tokens". At the top Select
                    "Custom token". Here you will paste the token address for
                    WPLS from above and click Next. Then click Import. Now you
                    can see your WPLS balance in MetaMask on the Ethereum
                    Network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now you are ready to bridge these tokens to the PulseChain

                    Network. You can easily switch networks in MetaMask by
                    clicking the Fox, going to the very top left, and clicking
                    the dropdown.

                  <li>
                    Click Approve in MetaMask. Next step is to bridge over the

                  Now you have crypto on the Ethereum network, the fees are high
                  there so its time to get over to a better network with low
                  fees. Lets move over to PulseChain. Head over to the bridge by
                  visiting

                    Click the Connect Your Wallet Button. Then click the

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now you can click the pink "MAX" text in the bridge window
                    to autofill in all of the WPLS tokens you now have. Or just
                    enter in how many WPLS tokens you want to send to the
                    PulseChain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Leave everything else the same, and click Send. Then click
                    the Send button again. MetaMask wil pop up to require you to
                    Confirm. It may take about 30 minutes to bridge over. Don't
                    panic, be patient!

                  <li>
                    After this is complete your Wrapped Pulse (WPLS) will arrive
                    on the PulseChain network in your wallet as Unwrapped Pulse
                    (PLS). PLS is the native token for PulseChain and will be
                    what is used for gas on the network. Transaction fees now in
                    2024 are only 1-2 cents each!! Sure beats the huge ETH fees.
                    Now you will be able to swap your PLS for ANY token on
                    PulseChain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once its done, change your network in MetaMask to PulseChain
                    to see all of your PLS! Get ready for Nachos!!!

                99% of the time you forgot to add the token address in your wallet! So you do have the tokens but its just not showing up because you forgot to add that specific token address. Tokens must be added on each network separately. So don‚Äôt forget to add PLS, PLSX, WPLS, NACHO etc as tokens in your wallet on PulseChain. See our guide for how to add tokens to your wallet. <br> Also make sure you are looking in the right network on MetaMask. If you are looking for your NACHO on ETH network you won't find them. So switch your MetaMask wallet back to the PulseChain to see your PulseChain tokens!

      Don‚Äôt worry! Now that you know how to bridge from the Ethereum network to the PulseChain network, getting back is the reverse process of our guide. One option is to swap everything to "DAI from Ethereum" on PulseChain and bridge the DAI back over to the Ethereum network. Then send your DAI to coinbase, and request a withdrawal straight to your bank account. This is not financial advice!

      If there is a lot of volume on the network things can take awhile! Bridging in particular can take quite a while‚Ä¶ hours even. This is because quite a few mechanisms must be propagated throughout the blockchain validators to confirm all of the moving pieces. Rest assured its on the way and don‚Äôt forget to add the token address to your wallet so you will actually see the coins when they show up!

      Sometimes a transaction doesn‚Äôt go through right away and is left in a pending state. If you try to make more transactions they will stack up and wait in order they were put in. This can sometimes be scary but there is a time period in which the transaction will time out if it does not go through successfully. So the best thing is to wait a couple hours and check back!

      What's a hot wallet vs cold wallet?

    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="faqbox5" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
    <div class="accordion-body">
      A hot wallet means that you are using it for a lot of different things, connecting to DEX‚Äôs for swapping, connecting to WEB3 apps and yield farming staking etc. This means the wallet could be vulnerable to being hacked if you are connecting it to a lot of different websites. If you mistakenly connect to a bad or fraudulent website you could end up inadvertently sending your crypto to scammers. So it's always good to keep your core bags (with the bulk of your funds) in a cold wallet! A cold wallet means that you don‚Äôt use it for everyday activities and really you only ever use it if you're going to move money back to your bank account. You would ideally buy a cheap computer and literally only set up a wallet on it and then disconnect from the internet and leave it in a secure place. It could also be a dedicated physical device designed for crypto such as a Trezor wallet or Ledger (which are hardware wallets). These are essentially the same as a computer but much smaller and similar to USB drives.

      PLS vs PLSX vs HEX

    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="faqbox6" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
    <div class="accordion-body">
      Pulse (PLS) is the native token on the PulseChain network. It is used as the currency for  transaction fees to perform transactions on the block chain. Ether (ETH) is the native token on the Ethereum network used to pay for performing transactions on the Ethereum network. So PLS by itself is what is used to pay the fees for doing anything on PulseChain. PulseX (PLSX) is the token of the PulseChain Decentralized Exchange (DEX). PLSX can be staked to earn rewards and provide liquidity to the network. The PLSX token doesn't actually perform any function and it is a forked version of the UNI token of Uniswap. It differs in that it has what's called ‚Äúbuy and burn‚Äù meaning everything a transaction is made some of the fee gets burned or removed permanently, thus the total supply of PLSX goes down over time. PLSX will get more scarce over time. HEX is a separate token created to act like a Certificate of Deposit. Users can stake their HEX and earn rewards. Please educate yourself as much as possible and consider reading straight from each website.<br>

      What does wrapped mean?

  </h2>
  <div id="faqbox8" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
    <div class="accordion-body">
      A wrapped token is simply a copy of a token that is pegged to its value. The use case is to move tokens across different networks. To move PLS to the ethereum network, you must wrap it into WPLS. Your original PLS is now locked away and you are given the equivalent amount of WPLS which can be bridged over to other crypto networks.

      What does ‚ÄúFrom Ethereum‚Äù mean on a token?

    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="faqbox9" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
    <div class="accordion-body">
      On PulseChain if you bridge an Ethereum token over to PulseChain, its commonly called ‚ÄúToken from Ethereum‚Äù. For example, ETH from Ethereum or DAI from Ethereum. PulseChain forked the entire Ethereum network and gave everyone a copy of whatever they had in their wallets at the time of launch. This means that whatever you had on the Ethereum network is also now a new token on PulseChain Network. So there are actually two versions of ETH on PulseChain: ETH from Ethereum which is wrapped ETH bridged over, and then just simply ETH which is the copy of ETH that lives on PulseChain only. Think of it like eETH and pETH. Just always be sure to be using the correct token addresses when interacting with any of these as there are a lot of fakes and frauds out there.
