        <div class="flexed">
          <div class="text">
            <h3>Only Two Uses</h3>
            <p>
              Centrailized exchanges should only be used as a means to get your
              fiat currency such as United States Dollars (USD) from your bank
              account and into a crypto coin. On the flip side, you also use centralized exchanges to transfer back out of crypto and into your bank account.
            </p>
            <h3>Don't Trade</h3>
            <p>
              Centralized exchanges SHOULD NOT be used to hold or trade crypto,
              they defeat the entire purpose of decentralized finance. They can
              seize your crypto, freeze your account, make terrible decisions
              and go bankrupt, or any number of things.
            </p>
            <h3>Hold your Keys</h3>
            <p>
              The beauty of DeFi crypto is that if you hold the keys to your
              own wallet, no one can take your crypto away from you. You are in
              complete control. You are insulated from the greed and corruption
              of centralized exchanges.
            </p>
            <h3>Freedom</h3>
            <p>
              Hey lets be honest you might invest in $hit coins or gamble on
              some lotto tokens that drop 90% however thats your prerogative!!!
              You should be in control of your own keys. We are rooting for you
              to get a Lambo!

                    Recovery Phrase is. There are a few names for this phrase;
                    "Secret Recovery Phrase", "Seed Phrase", "Master Wallet

                    to anyone, if anyone is asking your for this they are trying
                    to scam you. Print it out and store it in a safety deposit
                    box, password manager or some other secure place.

                <h3>Moving out of Coinbase</h3>
                <p>
                  Now it's time to transfer your ETH out of Coinbase and into
                  your newly created MetaMask wallet. What you‚Äôll need for this
                  step is the wallet address from MetaMask. The video below
                  outlines exactly how to do this.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Login to coinbase click the "Transfer" button at the top
                    right.
                  </li>
                  <li>Select the first option "Send Crypto".</li>
                  <li>
                    You can then specify the amount you would like to send.
                    Switch the view to ETH to send a specific amount of ETH such
                    as 0.5 ETH. Optionally you can specify the USD equivalent
                    amount of ETH to send.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next click "To: Network and Recipient". Click "Ethereum" as
                    that is the network we will be sending the crypto on. Now
                    you are ready to paste in the address of your MetaMask
                    wallet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click the fox icon in your browser to open your MetaMask
                    wallet. At the top there is a small pane where it shows some
                    of the first and last characters of your wallet address
                    "0xAKSK....90991" as an example. Click on this and it will
                    copy it to your clipboard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In coinbase paste your copied address in the search field at the
                    top entitled "Ethereum address or ENS" and hit Enter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click Preview Send. Here you will see an overview of what
                    will happen. How much ETH you are sending, how much ETH will
                    be spent as a transaction fee (gas fee), and to whom you are
                    sending. Please verify it is your wallet! The gas fees may be
                    high during times of high usuage on the network. Soon we
                    will be switching to a new network, PulseChain, where the
                    gas fees are more like one to two cents.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If everything looks good, send your ETH! It may take some
                    time to send over, Coinbase shows the estimated amount of
                    time for the transaction to be written to the blockchain.
                    After this the ETH will show up in your MetaMask Wallet!!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    CONGRATS!! At this point you have crypto which you actually
                    OWN the KEYS for!!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now lets work on getting to a more efficient network and
                    getting Nachos to celebrate!

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The PulseChain network has substantially cheaper

                    We are going to use a service called UniSwap to make the
                    switch. (There are many other ways to do this)

                    Click on Connect Wallet. Select the MetaMask Icon. Click
                    Next in the window. Then click Connect. Your wallet is now
                    connected and we are going to make the swap.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Note: Don't swap all of the ETH because you will need some
                    ETH later on for gas fees if you swap back to the ETH
                    network. We leave about $50 worth of ETH in there.

                  <li>
                    Click on Select Token. In the search bar paste in the WPLS
                    token address. The address is

                    Now choose your amount of ETH to swap, remembering to leave
                    some gas in the tank.

                  <li>
                    When you are ready, hit Swap. It will then ask you to review
                    and confirm the swap. Then MetaMask will pop up, scroll down
                    to click the blue Confirm Button.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After a few moments UniSwap will inform you that the swap
                    was succesful. In order to view the WPLS in your MetaMask
                    wallet on the Ethereum network, we will need to add the
                    token to MetaMask.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Click the fox to open MetaMask, Select the Tokens tab, and
                    then click the link "+ Import Tokens". At the top Select
                    "Custom token". Here you will paste the token address for
                    WPLS from above and click Next. Then click Import. Now you
                    can see your WPLS balance in MetaMask on the Ethereum
                    Network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now you are ready to bridge these tokens to the PulseChain

                  Now you have crypto on the Ethereum network, the fees are high
                  there so its time to get over to a better network with low
                  fees. Lets move over to PulseChain. Head over to the bridge by
                  visiting
                  <a href="https://bridge.pulsechain.com" target="_blank"
                    >https://bridge.pulsechain.com</a
                  >. Click the white button "Bridge.mypinata.cloud".

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Click the Connect Your Wallet Button. Then click the

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now you can click the pink "MAX" text in the bridge window
                    to autofill in all of the WPLS tokens you now have. Or just
                    enter in how many WPLS tokens you want to send the the
                    PulseChain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Leave everything else the same, and click Send. Then click
                    the Send button again. MetaMask wil pop up to require you to
                    Confirm. It may take about 30 minutes to bridge over. Don't
                    panic, be patient!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After this is complete your Wrapped Pulse (WPLS) will arrive
                    on the PulseChain network in your wallet as Unwrapped Pulse
                    (PLS). PLS is the native token for PulseChain and will be
                    what is used for gas on the network. Transaction fees now in
                    2024 are only 1-2 cents each!! Sure beats the huge ETH fees.
                    Now you will be able to swap your PLS for ANY token on
                    PulseChain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once its done, change your network in MetaMask to PulseChain
                    to see all of your PLS! Get ready for Nachos!!!

              telling me you are sorry. I‚Äôve been waiting days for a response
